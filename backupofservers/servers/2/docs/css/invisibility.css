/* Use this file to hide elements on the website, that you wish	*/
/* normally to be visible when viewed offline.			*/
/* If you wish to do the same, but vice-versa, just use SSI to  */
/* gain the effect, instead.					*/

/* How to use:							*/
/*  Add the below SSI comment in the head of the webpage:	*/
/*    <!--#include virtual="/SSI-HTML/visibility.html" -->	*/

/* When the page is opened locally, your browser will interpret	*/
/* the line as a comment and NOT open this visibility.css file.	*/
/* However, when the server processes the page, it will add	*/
/* this CSS file into the page.					*/
