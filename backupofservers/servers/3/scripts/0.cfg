// This is an example file that will be automatically executed upon AC startup.
// All .cfg files placed in this /scripts/ directory, will be automatically
// executed when you start AC.

// Files here are executed in alphabetical order, the order of priority is:
// 0-9, a-z, A-Z, and symbols. Therefore this file, (0.cfg) - will likely ALWAYS
// be executed before any other .cfg files you put into this directory. Use it
// for scripts that MUST be executed before others - for example.

// NOTE: The /config/autoexec.cfg can still be used to override anything!
